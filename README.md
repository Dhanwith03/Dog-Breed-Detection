## Multi Class Dog Breed Image Classification 
I went through each of these in the context of the 5 step machine learning framework:

**Problem defintion** - Use computer vision to classify photos of dogs into different dog breeds.

**Data** - 20,000+ images of dogs from 120 different dog breeds from the Stanford Dogs dataset.

**Evaluation** - Making sure our model reaches the minimum mark of accuracy

**Features** - Because we're using deep learning, our model will learn the features on its own.

**Modelling** - We're going to use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning.
